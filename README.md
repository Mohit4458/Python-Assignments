# PYTHON INTRODUCTION:-
                     Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language.
                     It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990.
                     Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
                  
# What can Python do?
    Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
    Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
    Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
    Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
    Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
    
    
# Python Indentation:-
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Example:-                                                                                                    
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")   
    OTPUT:-Five is greater than two!  
  
Syntax Error:                                                 OUTPUT:-ERROR  
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")  


# Python Comments:-
Comments can be used to explain Python code.
Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

Creating a Comment:-
Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
Example:-
#This is a comment                          OUTPUT:-Hello World!
print("Hello, World!")

# Multiline Comments:-
Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.

To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:
Example;
#This is a comment
#written in                 
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")
OUTPUT:-Hello World

Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.
Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
Example;
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")                   OUTPUT:-Hello World
